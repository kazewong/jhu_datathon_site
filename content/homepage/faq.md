    We will not be able to provide any computing resource for the participant. If you need GPU access, Google Colab could be a good place to start

            {{< detail-tag "Do I need to build a highly complicated neural network to win?" >}}
    Not at all! In fact, if you just have a big model but you cannot explain how it works, that will not rank very high in the competition. It is more important that you understand the data and come up with a fitting solution than building a complex model. Besides, since we will not provide any computational resources, it is a better strategy to stick with models which can be handled by personal computers.
